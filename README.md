# HeuristicAlgorithmsVisualisation

Programme made for subject Inteligent Systems (at RAF). On left click you add nodes. Heuristic function of the node is computed based on its distance to the first added node (marked wiht 0).
On right click you can select node and move it around.  Heuristic algortihms taken into consideration were: A*, FirstBest and HillClimbing.
Below is small demonstration of how it works:

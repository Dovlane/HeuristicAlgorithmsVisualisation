# HeuristicAlgorithmsVisualisation

Programme made for subject Inteligent Systems (at RAF). On left click you add nodes, and move them. Heuristic function of the node is computed based on its distance to the first added node (marked wiht 0).
On right click you can select two nodes and make edge between them.  Heuristic algortihms taken into consideration were: A* (yellow), FirstBest (green) and HillClimbing (red).
Below is small demonstration of how it works:
